Introduction
===============

MLPack (Machine Learning Package) is a set of tools and packages
that implements many of the popular machine learning algorithms.
There are many similar packages out there, MLPack is written out
of my own interest and acts as a consolidation of my machine learning
knowledge.

Besides containing many useful machine learning algorithms, this
package implements frameworks for easy extension and integration of
the algorithms, e.g. for writing new algorithms and using the code
in other algorithm packages.

The list of algorithms currently implemented and under development
are:

**Implemented**
   * Maximum Entropy Model (GIS and LBFGS training algorithm)
   * Naive Bayes Model
   * Hidden Markov Model

**Under development**
   * Support Vector Machines
   * Bayesian Network
